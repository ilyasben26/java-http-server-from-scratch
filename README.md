# Simple HTTP Server made in Java from scratch
A simple http server that does the following:
- Listens for incoming HTTP requests
- Handles and parses the incoming HTTP request
- Returns a predefined response

## What I learned from this project:
- Learned more about the HTTP protocol and how to implement it using the IETF documentation.  
- Working with threads in Java.
- Writing unit tests using JUnit.
- Test-driven development (used for properly implementing the HTTP parser).
- Using Maven to manage dependencies.
- Working with Streams.

## How to run:
1. Make sure you have Java 21 or later.
2. Download the jar file `simplehttpserver.jar` from the releases. 
3. Execute `java -jar simplehttpserver.jar`.
