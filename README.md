# Simple HTTP Server made in Java from scratch
A simple http server that does the following:
- Listens for incoming HTTP requests
- Handles and parses the incoming HTTP request
- Returns a predefined response

## What I learned from this project:
- Learning more about the HTTP protocol and implementing it using the IETF documentation.  
- Working with threads in Java.
- Writing unit tests using JUnit.
- Test-driven development (used for properly implementing the HTTP parser)
- Using Maven to manage dependencies.
- Working with Streams
